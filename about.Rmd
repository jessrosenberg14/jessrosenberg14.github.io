&nbsp;

I am currently a second year Master of Public Health student in the [Epidemiology Department](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/departments/epidemiology) at the [Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/). I am pursuing a Certificate in [Applied Biostatistics and Public Health Data Science](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/degrees/master-public-health/certificates/applied-biostatistics-and-public-health-data-science).

&nbsp;

At Mailman, I currently work as a Quantitative Research Assistant in for the [Global Health Justice and Governance Program](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/research/global-health-justice-and-governance) housed in the [Department of Population and Family Health](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/departments/population-family-health) on a project [Analyzing Title X Funding Changes](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/research/global-health-justice-and-governance/domestic-gag-rule). I also work as a Teaching Assistant for [Quantitative Foundations](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/become-student/degrees/masters-programs/masters-public-health/modules#quantitative), an introductory epidemiology and biostatistics course for first year masters students at Mailman.

&nbsp;

This past summer, I conducted analysis on a dataset from a recent contraceptive clinical trial in collaboration with [Dr. Carolyn Westhoff](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/clw3) to examine the success and utility of transvaginal ultrasounds for identifying follicles among non-pregnant reproductive-aged women. I also worked with [Gynuity Health Projects](https://gynuity.org/) conducting data analysis on their [TelAbortion Study](https://telabortion.org/) to better understand differences between populations receiving abortions in the study as compared to populations receiving abortions outside of the study. I will conduct my Masters Thesis using this same data.
