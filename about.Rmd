I also work as a Teaching Assistant for [Quantitative Foundations](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/become-student/degrees/masters-programs/masters-public-health/modules#quantitative), a course in the CORE, the curriculum first years masters students take at Mailman.

This past summer, I conducted data analysis on data from a recent contraceptive clinical trial in collaboration with [Dr. Carolyn Westhoff](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/clw3). I also worked with [Gynuity Health Projects](https://gynuity.org/) conducting data anlaysis on their [TelAbortion Study](https://telabortion.org/). I will conduct my Masters Thesis using this same data.
